# Red Dog Moped
The goal of this project is to create a simple repair process for customers of a small Nashville based moped/scooter shop. It should provide a means of requesting service for their bikes, a way to to monitor a repair's progress, and a way to track a bikes repair history.

Currently, users are able to sign in using a Google account, add bikes(along with editing and deleting them), and request service for them. I intend to add the ability to upload photos of their bikes in the future and also build out a similar interface for the mechanics at the shop where they can quickly recall a bike using a barcode or something similar and add notes on the repairs progress which the user will then be able to see from their account.
